# Exploring Montage Studio through a Sample Project

This document explains how to fork a GitHub repository to start to explore and use Montage Studio through a demo application.

To get started:

1. Go to the MontageJS [popcorn][1] repository on GitHub.

2. Click Fork in the upper right-hand corner, and then select your personal GitHub account.

    GitHub will replicate the contents of the repository.

3. Return to [work.montagestudio.com][2].

    You should see popcorn in your list of existing projects.
    
4. Click the popcorn project to open it in Montage Studio.

5. After the project has loaded, click the ui/main.reel directory in the Package explorer.

6. Start exploring.

    Tweak the bindings, add new components, modify the JavaScript source code, and perform any other changes that you want. When you save your changes, Montage Studio will automatically propagate them back to the GitHub repository.
